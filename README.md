# The Future in Tech

<img src="https://akhil-git-hub.github.io/RepoTest/images/photo.jpg" width="250">

Iâ€™m someone who is highly motivated and innovative. Possessing exceptional communicational and interpersonal skills, I have delivered seminars and lectures in college, improving my overall communication and presentational skills. I possess qualities to work independently and also in a Team. My peers regard me as very approachable, empathetic, and someone who takes pride in good quality.

Being a fast learner, I am adept in problem solving. Challenge myself with difficult puzzles always racks my brain; in doing so I learn way more. Experience is the key in life, be it at work and in personal life. It is always nice to meet new people and get to talk to them. Have been doing weekly Danish lessons with a native Dane.
